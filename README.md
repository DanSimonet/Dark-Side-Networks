## Dark-Side-Networks
Code and simulated dataset to reproduce analyses for 2017 SIOP Poster on Dark Triad as a causal network.

## Project and Data Description
This repository includes instructions, R syntax, and simulated data for the 2017 SIOP poster: "Dark personality as a causal system: A network approach." The following aspects of the project can be accessed.

- HDS item-level correlations (N = 62,997), descriptive statistics, and code for simulating a multivariate binary-item dataset in the `SimData-Syn.md` file.
- Simulated dataset of the 42-item Hogan Development Survey analog of the Dark Triad in `SimData.HDS`
- R syntax for replicating network diagrams and analyses in `DarkNet.Syn`
- Completed version of the poster in file called `...`

## Requirements

- R > 3.0 (possibly earlier versions will work)

The following R packages should be installed and loaded to simulate the item-level data and run network analyses. 

```
install.packages("bindata")
install.packages("psych")
install.packages("qgraph")
install.packages("parcor")
```
