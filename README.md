## Dark-Side-Networks
Code and simulated dataset to reproduce analyses for 2017 SIOP Poster on Dark Triad as a causal network

## Description
This repository includes instructions, R syntax, and simulated data for the 2017 SIOP poster: "Dark personality as a causal system: A network approach." 

## Requirements

- R > 3.0 (possibly earlier versions will work)

The following packages should install the required R packages for simulating 

```
install.packages("psych")
install.packages("qgraph"
install.packages("parcor")
```
## Data Description

A simulated dataset of the 42-item subset of the Dark Triad analog of the Hogan Developmental Survey (N = 62,997) is provided in the [SimData](https://github.com/Simmy56/Dark-Side-Networks/blob/readme-mods/SimData) folder. The code for simualting the multivariate binary-item dataset (i.e., True/False Items) is provided in the (/) folder.
